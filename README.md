# GAME
Welcome to the design documentation of GAME.

## Design Dogmas
1. Build-in localization - no text or speech.
2. Instant play - only menu is play, pause and exit.
3. Survival ARPG - Gather, eat, kill, loot, sleep, (repeat), die, repeat.
4. No base building - keep moving or find a safe spot.
5. Simple controls - move vertically and horizontally, attack, loot, equip/craft gear by.
6. Stuff decays - materials, food, armor, weapons, magic.
7. Limited inventory - sacrifice excess stuff to gods for rewards.
8. Goal - get higher score by killing, surviving, looting and exploring.
9. Lore - rare encoded rewarding secrets / missions.
10. Navigation - use the environment and objects.

## Marketing Strategy
I do not like marketing, so the game must market itself.

## Monetization
Pay a premium.

## Future works
Multiplayer
Real money trading / micro transactions
