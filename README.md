# GAME
Welcome to the design documentation of Amuse.

## Design Dogmas
1. Build-in localization - no text or speech.
2. Instant play - only menu is play, pause and exit.
3. Survival ARPG - Gather, eat, kill, loot, sleep, (repeat), die, repeat.
4. No base building - keep moving or find a safe spot.
5. Simple controls - move vertically and horizontally, attack, loot, equip/craft gear.
6. Stuff decays - materials, food, armor, weapons, magic.
7. Limited inventory - sacrifice excess stuff to gods for rewards.
8. Goal - get higher score by killing, surviving, looting and exploring.
9. Lore - rare encoded rewarding secrets / missions.
10. Navigation - use the environment and objects.

## Lore
The two prime gods, Zaokk - God of Chaos - and Aouoa - God of Order - had lived together for an eternity in their divine paradise, when they finally got bored of nothing ever happening. They decided to entertain themselves, by repeatedly creating dangerous worlds, wherein they would place different creatures. They would then satisfy their sadistic tendencies by observing and playing with the creatures, as the creatures desperately tried to survive. Gods like to have their egos stroked, so they would reward - or just not punish - the creatures, if the creatures made sacrifices to them. Reversely, gods can get jealous, if they are not worshipped, while other gods are... They called the concept Dunia.

## Marketing Strategy
I do not like marketing, so the game must market itself.

## Monetization
Pay a premium.
